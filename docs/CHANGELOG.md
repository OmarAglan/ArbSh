## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **ArbSh.Core Project**: Extracted the shell engine into a reusable class library (`src_csharp/ArbSh.Core`) containing parser, executor, cmdlets, models, and BiDi/i18n logic.
- **Host Output Abstraction**: Added `IExecutionSink`, `CoreConsole`, and `ShellEngine` to decouple command execution from terminal presentation.
- **ArbSh.Terminal Project**: Added a new Avalonia GUI host (`src_csharp/ArbSh.Terminal`) with app bootstrap, window/view model, and a custom `TerminalSurface` rendering entry point.
- **Phase 5.2 Rendering Pipeline**: Added `TerminalTextPipeline`, `TerminalLayoutEngine`, and render instruction models for output and prompt rendering.
- **Renderer Test Coverage**: Added terminal rendering tests in `ArbSh.Test` for pipeline transformation, visible frame windowing, and logical/visual separation.
- **Phase 5.3 Input Subsystem**: Added `TerminalInputBuffer`, `SelectionRange`, and `PromptLayoutSnapshot` for logical input editing, caret mapping, and selection geometry.
- **Input Test Coverage**: Added `TerminalInputBufferTests` for grapheme-safe delete/backspace, selection replacement, and caret movement boundaries.
- **Phase 5.4 Scrollback/Output Selection Models**: Added `TerminalFrameLayout` and `OutputSelectionBuffer` to support viewport windowing metadata and logical-order output selection/copy.
- **Phase 5.4 Test Coverage**: Added `OutputSelectionBufferTests` and new `TerminalLayoutEngine` scrollback-offset tests.

### Changed
- **Namespace Split**: Migrated engine namespaces from `ArbSh.Console.*` to `ArbSh.Core.*` for strict separation between core logic and host UI.
- **Console Host Refactor**: Updated `ArbSh.Console` to consume `ArbSh.Core` and route output through sink-based host boundaries.
- **Test Project Alignment**: Updated `ArbSh.Test` references/imports to validate the extracted `ArbSh.Core` engine.
- **Solution Composition**: Updated `ArbSh.sln` to include `ArbSh.Core` and `ArbSh.Terminal`.
- **TerminalSurface Rendering Path**: Replaced inline drawing/reordering logic with a dedicated render pipeline and runtime font fallback chain.
- **TerminalSurface Interaction Model**: Upgraded keyboard/mouse input handling to support visual caret navigation, selection extension, and clipboard operations.
- **Prompt Token Style**: Updated GUI prompt marker to RTL-oriented form `أربش< `.
- **Test Project Metadata**: Set `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` in `ArbSh.Test.csproj` so `dotnet test` executes tests instead of skipping.
- **Terminal Scrollback UX**: `TerminalSurface` and `TerminalLayoutEngine` now support scrollback offsets, mouse-wheel scrolling, and PageUp/PageDown navigation while keeping the prompt pinned at the bottom.
- **Clipboard Priority Rules**: `Ctrl+C` now copies output-history selections first (logical order) and falls back to prompt-input selection copy.

### Fixed
- **Engine/Host Coupling**: Removed direct dependence of core execution flow on `System.Console` output paths, enabling GUI-hosted rendering pipelines.
- **Logical/Visual Boundary Discipline**: Enforced visual transformation only in the terminal rendering layer while preserving logical strings in view-model state.
- **Broken Arabic Display in Avalonia Host**: Removed manual BiDi reordering before Avalonia text layout to prevent double reordering and reversed Arabic output.
- **Prompt Caret Misalignment (RTL)**: Updated terminal cursor placement to respect paragraph direction so caret aligns with RTL prompt/input flow.
- **Mixed BiDi Caret Placement**: Switched prompt caret position calculation to `TextLayout` hit-testing to align correctly for Arabic, English, and mixed prompt input.
- **Selection and Cursor Drift in Mixed Text**: Unified caret/selection logic on `TextLine` hit-testing to keep editing behavior stable across Arabic/English segments.
- **Scrollback Drift on Incoming Output**: Preserved reader position when new lines arrive while user is scrolled up in history.

## [0.7.7.1] - 2025-05-22

### Added

- **BiDi Algorithm Enhancement (Foundation):**
  - Integrated `ICU4N` library for accessing Unicode Character Database properties.
  - Refactored `BidiAlgorithm.GetCharType(int codepoint)` to use `ICU4N` for determining the UAX #9 `Bidi_Class` of Unicode codepoints, replacing previous hardcoded range checks. This provides significantly more accurate character type classification.
  - Updated `BidiCharacterType` enum to include `BN` (Boundary Neutral) and align more closely with UAX #9 terminology. LRM/RLM are now correctly classified as BN by `GetCharType`.

### Changed

- **Unit Tests (BiDi):** Updated and expanded unit tests for `BidiAlgorithm.GetCharType` to verify correct classification based on ICU data, including LRM, RLM (as BN), Tab (as S), and various other character types according to their UCD `Bidi_Class`. All `GetCharType` tests are now passing.
- Placeholder logic in `BidiAlgorithm.ProcessRuns` updated slightly to use the new `GetCharType` for its basic P2/P3 paragraph level detection. (Full `ProcessRuns` UAX #9 implementation is the next major task).

### Fixed

- Test failures in `BidiAlgorithmTests.cs` related to LRM/RLM classification are now resolved by updating tests to expect `BN` and refining `GetCharType`.

## [0.7.7] - 2025-05-22

### Added

- **Unit Testing (BiDi):** Introduced xUnit test project (`ArbSh.Test`).
- **Unit Testing (BiDi):** Added comprehensive unit tests for `BidiAlgorithm.GetCharType`, covering:
  - Basic character types (L, R, AL, EN, AN, WS, B).
  - Explicit directional formatting codes (LRE, RLE, PDF, LRO, RLO, LRI, RLI, FSI, PDI, LRM, RLM).
  - Other types (ES, CS, NSM, S, ON) and default classification logic.
- **Unit Testing (BiDi):** Added initial unit tests for `BidiAlgorithm.ProcessRuns` covering:
  - Purely LTR and purely RTL text scenarios with varying base paragraph directions.
  - Simple mixed LTR/RTL text.
  - Scenarios with explicit embedding codes (LRE, RLE, PDF) and nested embeddings. (Note: These tests revealed issues in `ProcessRuns` logic requiring further debugging).

### Changed

- **BiDi Algorithm:** Made an initial correction to `BidiAlgorithm.GetCharType` to prioritize `AN` (Arabic Number) check before the broader `AL` (Arabic Letter) check for overlapping Unicode ranges, resolving a test failure.
- **BiDi Algorithm:** Attempted refactoring of `BidiAlgorithm.ProcessRuns` to improve level assignment logic for runs, particularly around explicit formatting codes. (Note: This refactoring introduced regressions, currently under investigation).

### Fixed

- Corrected a misclassification in `BidiAlgorithm.GetCharType` where Arabic numbers were being identified as Arabic letters. Unit tests now confirm correct classification.

## [0.7.6] - 2025-05-07

### Added

- **Parser:** Added parsing support for type literals (e.g., `[int]`, `[string]`, `[System.ConsoleColor]`). Recognized via `TokenType.TypeLiteral` and stored as a special argument string (`"TypeLiteral:TypeName"`) in `ParsedCommand`.
- **Parser:** Added parsing support for input redirection (`< file.txt`). Recognized via `TokenType.Operator` (`<`) and stored in the new `InputRedirectPath` property of `ParsedCommand`.
- **BiDi Algorithm:** Ported core BiDi algorithm logic (determining character types, resolving embedding levels via explicit codes, reordering runs per Rule L2) from the original C implementation to `I18n/BidiAlgorithm.cs`. Includes `GetCharType`, `ProcessRuns`, `ReorderRunsForDisplay`, and `ProcessString` methods. (Note: Based on simplified C logic, requires testing and rendering integration).
- **Executor:** Implemented execution logic for input redirection (`< file.txt`). Reads specified file and provides content as pipeline input to the first command.
- **Executor:** Implemented execution logic for stream redirection merging (`2>&1`, `1>&2`). Output/Error objects are now correctly routed to the target stream's file handle or console stream based on merge directives.

### Fixed

- **Parser:** Correctly interpret standard escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\"`, `\\`, `\$`, etc.) within double-quoted strings (`StringLiteralDQ`). Added `ProcessEscapesInString` helper method. Single-quoted strings remain literal.
- **Parser:** Fixed sub-expression (`$(...)`) parsing regression. Nested sub-expressions and pipelines within them are now parsed correctly without causing "unterminated" errors or incorrect token consumption.
- Fixed build warnings related to unused variables in `Executor.cs`'s output handling logic.
- Fixed build warning related to empty switch block in `I18n/BidiAlgorithm.cs`.

### Changed

- Updated `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect completion of Phase 3 parsing enhancements and Phase 4 progress (BiDi porting, redirection execution).

## [0.7.5] - 2025-05-06

### Fixed

- **Encoding Issues:** Resolved persistent UTF-8 input/output corruption when running via PowerShell `Start-Process` with redirected streams. This involved:
  - Setting `StandardInputEncoding`, `StandardOutputEncoding`, and `StandardErrorEncoding` to UTF-8 in `test_features.ps1`.
  - Modifying `Program.cs` to use `StreamReader` with explicit UTF-8 encoding for `Console.OpenStandardInput()` and ensuring `Console.OutputEncoding` is also UTF-8.
  - Arabic commands/parameters and output are now handled correctly in test scenarios.
- **Variable Expansion Regression:** Fixed the parser logic in `Parser.cs` to correctly handle variable expansion (`$var`) within arguments, ensuring adjacent tokens are concatenated properly (e.g., `ValueIs:$testVar` now works as expected). Implemented using a `StringBuilder` in the argument parsing loop.

### Changed

- Updated `README.md` and `docs/USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` to reflect the encoding and variable expansion fixes.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` to mark the encoding blocker as resolved and the variable expansion fix as complete.
- **Tokenizer Refactoring:** Replaced the internal state-machine tokenizer with a new Regex-based tokenizer (`Parsing/RegexTokenizer.cs`) using Unicode properties (`\p{L}`) for potentially better handling of mixed-script identifiers and complex syntax elements. Created `Parsing/Token.cs` for token definitions. Integrated the new tokenizer into `Parser.cs`.
- **Parser Logic:** Updated redirection and argument/parameter parsing logic in `Parser.cs` to work with the new `List<Token>` structure.
- **Redirection Parsing:** Refined Regex patterns in `RegexTokenizer.cs` and parsing logic in `Parser.cs` to correctly identify and parse all standard redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `2>`, `2>>`, `>&1`, `>&2`).
- **Executor Redirection Handling:**
  - Implemented handling for stdout file redirection (`>`, `>>`) in `Executor.cs`.
  - Implemented handling for stderr file redirection (`2>`, `2>>`) in `Executor.cs`.
  - Fixed null path error when no redirection was specified.
- **Error Handling:** Added `IsError` flag to `PipelineObject.cs` and updated `GetHelpCmdlet.cs` to use it for "command not found" errors.
- **Test Script:** Updated `test_features.ps1` to log temporary file contents line-by-line to avoid `Add-Content` stream errors. Changed default file encoding for `test_output.log` to UTF-8 with BOM.

### Known Issues / Regressions

- **Tokenizer:**
  - Input redirection operator `<` is not yet recognized.
  - Mixed-script identifiers (e.g., `Commandمرحبا`) need verification/improvement.
- **Parser:**
  - Sub-expression `$(...)` parsing is implemented, but execution is not.
  - Type literals `[int]` are not yet parsed.
- **Execution:**
  - Stream redirection merging (`2>&1`, `1>&2`) is parsed but not implemented in the Executor.
  - Sub-expression execution is not implemented.

## [0.7.0] - 2025-05-03

### Added

- **Arabic Command Name Support:**
  - Extended the parser (`Parser.cs`) to recognize Arabic letters as valid characters in command/argument tokens.
  - Added `ArabicNameAttribute.cs` to allow specifying an Arabic alias for a cmdlet class.
  - Updated `CommandDiscovery.cs` to read the `ArabicNameAttribute` and add both English and Arabic names to the command cache.
  - Cmdlets can now be invoked using either their English name (e.g., `Get-Help`) or their assigned Arabic name (e.g., `احصل-مساعدة`).
- **Arabic Parameter Name Support:**
  - Updated `ArabicNameAttribute` to be applicable to properties (parameters).
  - Modified the parameter binding logic in `Executor.cs` to check for `ArabicNameAttribute` on properties and attempt binding using the Arabic name first, falling back to the English name.
  - Cmdlet parameters can now be specified using either their English name (e.g., `-CommandName`) or their assigned Arabic name (e.g., `-الاسم`).
- **Testing:** Added tests to `test_features.ps1` for Arabic command/parameter aliases.

### Fixed

- **Parser Tokenization:** Corrected tokenizer logic (`Parser.cs`) to properly handle hyphens within command names (e.g., `Get-Command`) and dots within arguments/filenames (e.g., `temp_file.txt`), preventing incorrect splitting.
- **Redirection:** Resolved issue where output redirection (`>`, `>>`) failed due to incorrect filename parsing. Files are now created correctly. Added explicit `Flush()` calls in `Executor.cs` for robustness.
- **Test Script Encoding:** Fixed `test_features.ps1` to correctly send UTF-8 encoded input to the ArbSh process by writing bytes directly to the standard input stream, enabling proper testing of Arabic characters. Confirmed successful parsing and execution of Arabic aliases.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-05-02

### Changed

- **Pipeline Execution:** Refactored the `Executor` to use `System.Threading.Tasks.Task` and `System.Collections.Concurrent.BlockingCollection` for true concurrent execution of pipeline stages within a statement, replacing the previous sequential simulation. Each cmdlet now runs in its own task, improving potential parallelism. Includes basic error handling for task failures using `Task.WhenAll` and `AggregateException`.
- **Cmdlet Logic & Pipeline Binding:**
  - Enhanced `ParameterAttribute` to include `ValueFromPipeline` and `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` flags.
  - Added `BindPipelineParameters` virtual method to `CmdletBase` to handle binding pipeline input to parameters based on the new flags (called by Executor before `ProcessRecord`).
  - Updated `GetHelpCmdlet` to display pipeline input acceptance details for parameters when using the `-Full` switch.
  - Updated `WriteOutputCmdlet` to declare `ValueFromPipeline=true` for its `InputObject` parameter and handle processing pipeline input vs. direct parameter value.
  - Updated `GetCommandCmdlet` to output structured `Models.CommandInfo` objects instead of just strings.
  - Refined parameter binding in `Executor.cs` to throw specific `ParameterBindingException` on type conversion errors (named and positional) instead of just logging warnings.
  - Added support in `Executor.cs` for binding remaining positional arguments to a parameter with an array type (e.g., `string[]`).

  - Added `ParameterAttribute.cs` for marking cmdlet parameters.
  - Updated `GetHelpCmdlet.cs` and `GetCommandCmdlet.cs` to use `[Parameter]` attribute.
  - Implemented parameter binding logic in `Executor.cs` using reflection, including mandatory parameter checks (throwing `ParameterBindingException`), stricter boolean switch handling, and improved type conversion using `TypeConverter` / `Convert.ChangeType`.
  - Added `CommandDiscovery.cs` to find available cmdlets using reflection.
  - Updated `Executor.cs` to use `CommandDiscovery`, handle `ParameterBindingException`, and use the refined binding logic.

  - Updated `Executor.cs` with basic sequential pipeline logic (passing output of one command to the input of the next via `BlockingCollection`), confirmed working with `Get-Command | Write-Output`.
  - Updated `Parser.cs` to handle the pipeline operator (`|`).
  - Implemented basic logic for `GetHelpCmdlet` using reflection to display command syntax and parameters.
  - Implemented basic logic for `GetCommandCmdlet` using `CommandDiscovery` to list commands.
- Updated documentation (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`) to reflect the new C# direction and refactoring status.
- Updated `.gitignore` for C#/.NET development.

### Changed

- Project direction shifted towards a PowerShell-inspired C# shell with Arabic command support.
- Build system transitioned from CMake to .NET CLI.
- Moved original C/C++ source, include, tests, cmake, build files into `old_c_code/` directory for reference.

### Deprecated

- The existing C implementation (now in `old_c_code/`) is considered legacy and primarily serves as a reference for porting i18n logic.
- CMake build system (now in `old_c_code/`).
