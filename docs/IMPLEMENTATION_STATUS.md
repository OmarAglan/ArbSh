# ArbSh Implementation Status

This document tracks the current implementation status of the ArbSh project based on the roadmap.

## Recent Implementations

### Configuration System
- âœ… Implemented INI-like configuration file format
- âœ… Added automatic directory creation for config files
- âœ… Implemented the `config` command with init/path options
- âœ… Added configuration loading at shell startup
- âœ… Implemented history file path configuration
- âœ… Added keyboard layout configuration

### History and Aliases
- âœ… Implemented file locking for history to prevent corruption between GUI and console modes
- âœ… Added alias persistent storage in `~/.arbsh_aliases`
- âœ… Implemented alias loading at startup
- âœ… Added `alias -s` command to save aliases
- âœ… Added `alias -l` command to reload aliases

### GUI-Console Integration
- âœ… Implemented GUI host detection through environment variables
- âœ… Modified prompt and output behavior based on GUI/Console mode
- âœ… Added environment variable propagation to child processes

## Current Work in Progress

### BiDi Text Support
- ðŸŸ¡ Enhancing RTL text handling for better Arabic display
- ðŸŸ¡ Implementing consistent bidirectional algorithm across all output functions

### Theming & UI Enhancement
- ðŸŸ¡ Adding color configuration in the settings system
- ðŸŸ¡ Implementing terminal color support for better visual experience

## Next Steps Prioritized

1. Complete the review of all output functions to ensure proper BiDi handling
2. Add color themes and implement color settings in the configuration system
3. Improve Arabic keyboard layout support with better layout switching
4. Implement consistent UTF-8 error reporting across the application
5. Begin work on `libArbShCore` feasibility study

## Build Status

The current build is stable with all features operational. The most recent changes include:
- Fixed file locking for robust history sharing between GUI and console modes
- Added alias persistence
- Implemented GUI detection
- Fixed build issues related to missing declarations

## Known Issues

- Some minor warnings about C23 attributes in the codebase
- BiDi text handling needs further improvement for complex Arabic text
