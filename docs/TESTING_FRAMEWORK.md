  - Test text reordering for display
  - Test with various bidirectional text scenarios

- **Locale System**
  - Test language detection and switching
  - Test message retrieval in different languages
  - Test locale-specific formatting

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests should verify that components work together correctly:

  - Test redirection with Arabic content

- **Shell Script Execution**
  - Test execution of scripts containing Arabic text
  - Test script output with bidirectional content
  - Test error handling in scripts with Arabic

### 3. Arabic-Specific Tests

Specialized tests for Arabic language features:

- **Arabic Text Input**
  - Test input of Arabic characters
  - Test cursor movement in Arabic text
  - Test editing operations (insert, delete) in RTL context
  - Test keyboard layout switching

- **Arabic Text Display**
  - Test proper display of Arabic characters
  - Test text alignment and justification
  - Test line wrapping with Arabic text
  - Test display of mixed Arabic/Latin text

- **Bidirectional Algorithm**
  - Test with complex bidirectional text scenarios
  - Test with nested bidirectional text
  - Test with numeric sequences in RTL context
  - Test with special formatting characters (LRM, RLM, etc.)

- **Arabic Commands**
  - Test command history with Arabic commands
  - Test command completion with Arabic text
  - Test alias system with Arabic names

### 4. Platform-Specific Tests

Tests for platform-specific behaviors:

- **Windows Tests**
  - Test console configuration for Arabic
  - Test Windows-specific UI elements
  - Test font selection and rendering
  - Test integration with Windows terminal

- **Unix/Linux Tests**
  - Test terminal configuration for Arabic
  - Test integration with various terminal emulators
  - Test with different locale settings

### 5. Performance Tests

Benchmarks to measure performance:

- **Arabic Text Processing**
  - Measure UTF-8 processing performance
  - Benchmark bidirectional algorithm implementation
  - Test performance with large Arabic text files

- **Command Execution**
  - Measure command execution time with Arabic parameters
  - Benchmark script execution with Arabic content

## Test Data and Fixtures

### Text Samples

Create a comprehensive set of text samples for testing:

1. **Basic Arabic Text**
   ```
   مرحبا بالعالم
   ```

2. **Mixed Directional Text**
   ```
   هذا النص يحتوي English words في وسطه
   ```

3. **Arabic with Numbers**
   ```
   العدد ١٢٣٤٥ والعدد 67890
   ```

4. **Text with Diacritics**
   ```
   العَرَبِيَّة مَعَ تَشْكِيل كَامِل
   ```

5. **Complex Bidirectional Text**
   ```
   This is English text with العربية in the middle and more English
   ```

6. **Nested Bidirectional Text**
   ```
   هذا نص عربي (with English (وعربي) inside) ونهاية عربية
   ```

### Test Scripts

Create test scripts that exercise various shell features with Arabic content:

1. **Basic Command Script**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Test basic Arabic output
   echo "مرحبا بالعالم"
   # Test Arabic variable names
   متغير="قيمة"
   echo $متغير
   ```

2. **Complex Script with Mixed Text**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # Test complex bidirectional handling
   for i in {1..5}; do
     echo "العدد $i من ٥"
   done
   ```

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration

Implement CI pipeline with the following stages:

1. **Build** - Compile the shell on multiple platforms
2. **Unit Tests** - Run unit tests
3. **Integration Tests** - Run integration tests
4. **Arabic Tests** - Run specialized Arabic tests
5. **Performance Tests** - Run performance benchmarks
6. **Code Quality** - Run static analysis and code coverage

### Test Execution

Create scripts for running different test categories:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh

# Run only Arabic-specific tests
./run_tests.sh --category arabic

# Run tests with code coverage
./run_tests.sh --coverage
```

## Regression Testing

Implement a system for regression testing:

1. Create test cases for each fixed bug
2. Automatically run regression tests before each release
3. Document the expected behavior for each regression test
4. Track test results over time

## Test Documentation

### Test Case Format

Each test case should include:

1. **Description** - What the test is checking
2. **Prerequisites** - Required setup
3. **Test Steps** - Detailed steps to execute
4. **Expected Results** - What should happen
5. **Actual Results** - What actually happens
6. **Pass/Fail Criteria** - How to determine success

### Example Test Case

```
Test ID: BIDI-001
Description: Verify correct display of mixed Arabic/English text
Prerequisites: Shell configured with UTF-8 support
Test Steps:
  1. Enter the command: echo "Hello مرحبا World العالم"
  2. Observe the output
Expected Results: Text should display with correct bidirectional ordering
Pass Criteria: Arabic text appears right-to-left, English left-to-right
```
